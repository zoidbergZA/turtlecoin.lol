# Section - The story

1. The Story
2. Our Background
3. Most TurtleCoin Contributors have thick, luscious beards. <strong>FACT.</strong></h3>
4. <em>This gives us <strong>+10xp Chin Stroke</strong> abilities, and enhances our patience and diagnostic skills. <i class="far fa-smile"></i></em>
5. The truth is, most of us are full-time developers on other projects, and this is our way to give back to the community with something fun.
6. How we started it
7. One chilly December night, RockSteady and Bebop were having a beer too many while discussing the madness around fake, flimsy ICOs with no product. Bebop surmised that it just wouldn't be possible to put out a real project now days without a serious team, doing serious marketing, and bringing in serious funding.
8. RockSteady leaned in closely, stroked his beard intently, and had only one response..
9. <strong>"Hold my beer."</strong>
10. That night, December 9th, 2017, TurtleCoin was born.
12. Why?
13. Too many projects are bringing in <strong>too much funding</strong> despite most having <strong>no damn product</strong>. We figured, "why not do the whole thing in reverse? Start with a fun project, make it as simple and accessible as possible, and let it grow on its own.
14. We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, <strong>the value will create itself</strong>. If you think we're wrong, we're happy to <a href="http://meta.turtlecoin.lol">talk</a> about it.
15. A wise rat once said, "A turtle only moves forward by sticking his neck out.."

# Section  - Roadmap

1. Hello Turtle
2. TurtleCoin was born <strong>December 9th, 2017</strong>.
3. In the beginning, we were command line only, compiled only for Linux, and got banned repeatedly from online forums for hosting flash TRTL giveaways.
4. GUI Wallets
5. TurtleCoin Community has been hard at work to bring us a diverse graphical experience, as well as refreshing the command line wallet also. From day one, we've been committed to making TurtleCoin easier, and that starts with a good GUI. Take your pick of one of the following wallets:
6. Market Partnerships
7. We pledged to have our TurtleCoins being publicly trading by Q2 2018, and we have accomplished that goal in several markets.
8. Development Started, Q2 2018
9. Mobius, Fast Blocks No Sync
10. A big headache with proof of work is syncing a huge chain, and fast blocks don't usually help that issue. Our goal is producing faster blocks on a shorter chain. This is perhaps the most aggressive goal, and will require the most help to complete.
11. TBA (To be announced)
12. Karai, Simple Smart Contracts
13. Distributed, trustless networks have uses beyond currency. Karai is our goal for enabling distributed applications and networks beyond the main blockchain.
14. TurtlePay Network
15. What good is an ATM if it isn't nearby? Tap-and-pay is yesterday; Tap-and-earn is tomorrow. Your nearest Crypto ATM is in your pocket.
